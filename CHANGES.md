# WinFCU
WinFCU is a rule based utility which keeps the file system clean by archiving/deleting/moving unwanted/unneeded files from the file system  
WinFCU can be run interactivly, as a scheduled task or as a service

## V2.5.0.3

The complete Visual Studio solution is now published to Git, so enjoy!  

## 2.4.16.0

Fixed a bug with reloading schedules  
Added some example data to the WinFCU.exe.config file  

## 2.4.16.1

Fixed `-show keywords` output formatting  
Stripped version from installer filename  
Fixed LogFiles folder spec in example file  

## 2.4.16.2

Clear total counts before a run starts  

## 2.4.17.x

Made exclude into a inherritable default attribute  
Installer can install basic include files  
Fix `-show status` output (added default exclude status)  
Fix error in counting deleted bytes  
Fix PathTooLong breaking error, fullname of offerender is logged  
Fix typos in config files

## 2.4.18.x

Code refactoring, eliminating obsolete pieces  
Service handling improved, now also start, stop, restart and status (requires elevation!)

## 2.4.19.x

More code refactoring  
- Include files now can have a system attribute in the `<applicationSettings>` root node, limiting the inclusion of these files to matching systems only `<applicationSettings system="^myserver-[abc]$" >`  
- Include files now can contain keyword and schedule definitions, allowing to limit these definitions to the content of these files only  
- `-show status` will show all include files found, but marks excluded files with a preceeding '*'  
  
For include file changes see `WinFCU_SharePoint.config` example file (only in repo, not part of the installer!)  
  
Installer changes  
- The installer no longer creates a StartMenu item  
- The installer now uses sc.exe to create/delete/start/stop the WinFCU service  
- Updated WinFCU_Users.config, cleanup CrashDumps folder

Bug Fix  
- Collecting file information could generate an uncatched IOException  

New functionality  
- Added LongPathsEnabled detection, issue a warning when not enabled  

## 2.4.20.x

New functionality  
- A schedule can be strict or not (strict=[true/false]). A non-strict schedule will add a delta (based on (one of) the system mac address(es)) to the startime. This will allow for distribution of load when running in an environment with multiple servers and shared storage. The delta can vary from 0 minutes (Mac = 00-00-00-00-00-00) to 51 minutes (Mac = FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)  

Config change  
- Change start time of Sharepoint to 00:30 to avoid collision with non-strict daily schedule  
- Update to WinFCU.exe.config to enable LongPaths support with .Net 4.5

Bug Fix
- GetMacAddress could return an empty string, when no mac address is found 00-00-00-00-00-00 will be returned
- Fix int32 conversion of hex parts of mac address
- Wait 5 seconds with reloading configs after config change  

## 2.4.20.8

Config Change  
- Added user keyword `@Yesterday@` - Yesterdays date in `yyyyMMdd` format (can be used with log rotate actions)
- Added recovery settings to de service (restart 2 minutes after failing)

## 2.4.21.0

Bug fix
- Fixed 'Stream was too long' error in archiver fucntion

## 2.4.25.2

New functionality  
- WinFCU by default follows symbolic links thereby processing everything it finds in its path.  
  This behaviour can now be managed using `followsymlimks=[true|false]`. This is an inherritable option and it can be used at any level (folders, folder, files)
  The default behaviour is still to follow symlinks (`followSymlinks="true"`), except for the temp file cleanup in the `WinFCU_Users.config` include file

## 2.5.0.3

New and changed functionality
- `followsymlinks` is now by default false
- Format of some of the log messages has changed
- Introduction of Specials!! Specials are hardcoded actions which can be enabled or disabled, be assigned to one or more specific systems and/or have their own schedule.  
  A separate config file has been included (WinFCU_Specials.config), and the 1st (and yet only) special is `WindowsInstaller `. This special removes obsolete and
  superseded packages and patches from the Windows Installer folder
- Reduced number of logmessages generated by the DeleteEmptyFolders function
